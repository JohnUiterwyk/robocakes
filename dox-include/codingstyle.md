Coding Style 			{#codingstyle}
============

Coding style for this project has been guiding by the Linux Kernel coding
style, since this is a project targeted at Linux. The advantage of using the
Kernel style guide is that while it may be occasionally barmy (8 spaces per
tab?), it is *very* opinionated, so there is never any cause for confusion.
