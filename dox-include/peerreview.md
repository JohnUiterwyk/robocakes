Peer Review Summary 		{#peerreview}
===================

Overall the feedback we received was positive. Some areas for improvement that
were noted were:

Our presentation attempted to cover as much ground as possible and as such
some commented that it was rushed and there was perhaps too much detail for
a summary presentation and demonstration, given the time allowed. This perhaps
led to our presentation being less informative than it could have been and
some middling ratings for our interpersonal skills and ability to maintain the
audience interest. 

Despite this the majority of feedback rated our project as excellent. Most
agreed that we had met all learning objectives to a high standard and
demonstrated our implementations of key OS concepts.
