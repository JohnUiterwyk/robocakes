Introduction 					{#introduction}
============

This document describes the methodologies, application, concepts, resources,
analysis, and results of Team Robocakes Operating System Principles major
project.  The main focus of our teams efforts was the creation of the Hydra
application.
  
Hydra is a low cost distributed rendering system for a 2d physics simulation.
The application makes uses of a client / server architecture, with one
Raspberry Pi acting as a server, and one or more Raspberry Pi's acting as
display clients.  The application makes use of a multithreaded bidirectional
TCP implementation for messaging, OpenVG and OpenGL ES for visualizations, and
Automake for cross platform development and distribution.


The resulting application is an original creation that is fully functional and
achieves our original goals. Through the course of developing the application
we demonstrated mastery of project management and teamwork, mastery of complex
system level Linux application development on a resource constrained device,
and mastery of multiple key OS concepts.
