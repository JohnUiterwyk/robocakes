Goals and Objectives  					{#goalsobjectives}
====================

The goal of this project was to design, develop and test a complex
system-level program that provides networking and graphics functionality. We
were focused on developing the application  using industry best practices and
tools as well as demonstrating thought leadership in regards to teamwork and
project management. We desired to achieve the learning objectives through
direct implementation of the designed functionality using low level system
calls. Additionally sought to analyze the performance impact of various
components and use that information to inform our development roadmap.
