Summary of the Demonstration 			{#demosummary}
============================

Our demonstration of our project was successful. We set-up three Raspberry
Pi's, wired via a router to maximise bandwidth (the wireless spectrum being
saturated) and plugged each device into a display. While we presented a series
of slides, our application ran at 50 frames per second without issues.
