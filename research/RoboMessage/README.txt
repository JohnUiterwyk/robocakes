So RoboMessage is a simple UDP client server program.
Instructions:
>make all
First, open two terminals.
Then start the client:
>./RoboClient
Then start the server to send messages to the broadcast addrress
>./RoboServer 192.168.0.255
RoboServer will give you a prompt :::
Type in whatever and see it miraculously appear in the Client.

MAGIC! (cue jazz hands)
